Soon:

add *_velocity.png to threadscope

colour (<@dcoutts> eg black duds, green created and red overflows)

indicate somewhere than the area below the graph corresponds to
the total cumulated number of sparks created/disposed

make sure the interval is reasonable for usual data

use something akin to EventTree and DurationTree to store aggregations
and raw data at the bottom

25%/50%/75% percentile for pool size, in gnuplot

Later:

if needed, optimize Haskell math: memory leaks, Int instead of Integer, etc.

add pool size to threadscope

automatically set the interval size, depending on zoom factor,
to represent a constant number of pixels



Far future:

look for some other parallel programs to test

let the user set the interval size, as an advanced option

scroll around the graph image via a small zoomed out window
"The Information Mural: A Technique for Displaying and Navigating Large Information Spaces"

use adaptive interval, depending on the sample density at the viewed fragment
