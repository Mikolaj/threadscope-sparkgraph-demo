Soon:

add *_velocity.png to threadscope

colour (<@dcoutts> eg dull grey/brown duds, green created and red overflows)

indicate somewhere than the area below the graph corresponds to
the total cumulated number of sparks created/disposed

make sure the interval is reasonable for usual data

25%/50%/75% percentile for pool size, in gnuplot
http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.10.6199
figure 15

we should be able to turn SparksHEC on/off in the traces pane

consider making the graphs more accurate by drilling down the tree
to the base events at each slice borders:
10:14 <@mikolaj> they don't go down to the base events at each slice boundary
10:15 <@mikolaj> but only at the two viewport borders (hence the extra slices at the ends dcoutts noticed)

or increse the accuracy by dividing increments not by the slice
length (implicitly), but the length of the sum of tree node spans
that cover the slice, similarly as in gnuplot graphs

automatically set the interval size, depending on zoom factor,
to represent a constant number of pixels


Later:

add pool size to threadscope

animate zoom level transitions:
13:00 <@dcoutts> mikolaj: over the weekend I was idly thinking about ways to make the zoom in/out less confusing for users (e.g. the sudden appearance of spikyness once
 you pass certain thresholds)
13:01 <@dcoutts> mikolaj: this isn't something to do now of course, but I though animating the transitions would make it clearer
13:02 <@dcoutts> generate the bitmap of the higher resolution new view, and animate it expanding to cover the new view
13:02 <@dcoutts> it'd be quick since it's just bitmap scaling
13:02 <@dcoutts> so the user can see the region in the old view that is expanding out to become the new view

merge adjacent 0 samples:
14:07 <@dcoutts> if we have equal adjacent samples we just take the second/last
14:07 <@dcoutts> can be done when it's still a list, before making the tree
14:07 <@dcoutts> simple linear pass
14:07 <@dcoutts> and lazy too


Far future:

look for some other parallel programs to test

let the user set the interval size, as an advanced option

scroll around the graph image via a small zoomed out window
"The Information Mural: A Technique for Displaying and Navigating Large Information Spaces"

use adaptive interval, depending on the sample density at the viewed fragment
